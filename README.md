# svm-2d
Supervised learning using Support Vector Machines on 2-dimensional datasets

Notebooks:
- svm-linear: SVM with a linear kernel and visualisation of the hyperplane
- svm-rbf: SVM with Radial Basis Function kernel and visualisation of the non-linear boundary
- svm-poly: SVM with Polynomial kernel and visualisation of the boundary contour

Tools used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Takeaways:
- SVMs are great for efficiently avoiding overfitting to outliers
- C can significantly affect performance of an SVM
- Playing with C can significantly increase accuracy of a fuzzy boundary
- Meshgrid is convenient for plotting nonlinear boundaries
